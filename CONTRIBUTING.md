# Contributing to MCP VS Code Workflow

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the MCP VS Code Workflow project! This guide will help you understand our contribution process and quality standards.

## ðŸ“‹ Before You Start

**All contributions must meet our comprehensive [acceptance criteria](docs/acceptance-criteria.md).** Please review this document thoroughly before submitting any changes.

## Quick Start for Contributors

1. **Fork the repository** and clone your fork
2. **Install development dependencies**: `make dev-setup`
3. **Create a feature branch**: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`
4. **Make your changes** following our guidelines
5. **Test thoroughly**: `make ci-local`
6. **Submit a pull request**

## Development Workflow

### 1. Environment Setup
```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/your-username/mcp-vscode-workflow.git
cd mcp-vscode-workflow

# Set up development environment
make dev-setup

# Install pre-commit hooks
make setup-hooks
```

### 2. Making Changes

#### Code Quality Requirements
- Run `make lint` to check code formatting
- Run `make format` to auto-fix formatting issues
- Run `make security` to check for security issues
- Run `make test` to run the test suite

#### Testing Requirements
- All tests must pass: `make test`
- New features must include tests
- Bug fixes must include regression tests
- Maintain or improve test coverage

#### Documentation Requirements
- Update relevant documentation for changes
- Add examples for new features
- Update installation instructions if needed
- Validate all links and references

### 3. Validation Before Submitting

Run the full CI pipeline locally:
```bash
make ci-local
```

This command runs:
- Tool validation (`make check-tools`)
- Configuration validation (`make validate-configs`)
- Code linting (`make lint`)
- Security scanning (`make security`)
- Test suite with coverage (`make test-coverage`)
- Pre-commit hooks (`make run-hooks`)
