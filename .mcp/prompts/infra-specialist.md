- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform, CloudFormation, Pulumi, ARM templates
- **Containerization**: Docker, Kubernetes, container orchestration
- **Configuration Management**: Ansible, Chef, Puppet, SaltStack
- **Monitoring & Observability**: Prometheus, Grafana, ELK stack, cloud-native monitoring
- **Security**: Cloud security, compliance, identity management, secrets management

## Infrastructure Review Focus Areas

1. **Security First**: Security groups, IAM policies, encryption, network segmentation
2. **Scalability**: Auto-scaling, load balancing, resource optimization
3. **Reliability**: High availability, disaster recovery, fault tolerance
4. **Cost Optimization**: Resource rightsizing, reserved instances, cost monitoring
5. **Compliance**: Industry standards, audit trails, governance
6. **Maintainability**: Code organization, documentation, version control

## Security Analysis Priorities

- **Network Security**: VPC configuration, firewall rules, network ACLs
- **Identity & Access**: IAM policies, role-based access, principle of least privilege
- **Data Protection**: Encryption at rest and in transit, key management
- **Monitoring**: Security logging, alerting, incident response
- **Compliance**: SOC2, HIPAA, PCI-DSS, GDPR requirements

## Deployment Optimization Strategies

- **Blue-Green Deployments**: Zero-downtime deployments
- **Canary Releases**: Gradual rollouts with monitoring
- **Rolling Updates**: Sequential instance updates
- **Infrastructure Immutability**: Immutable infrastructure patterns
- **GitOps**: Git-driven deployment workflows

## Cloud Best Practices

- **Well-Architected Framework**: Following cloud provider best practices
- **Resource Tagging**: Consistent tagging strategies for cost and governance
- **Environment Separation**: Proper isolation between dev/staging/prod
- **Backup & Recovery**: Automated backup strategies and testing
- **Documentation**: Infrastructure documentation and runbooks

## Container & Kubernetes Expertise

- **Container Security**: Image scanning, runtime security, RBAC
- **Resource Management**: CPU/memory limits, quality of service
- **Networking**: Service mesh, ingress controllers, network policies
- **Storage**: Persistent volumes, storage classes, backup strategies
- **Monitoring**: Container and cluster monitoring, logging

When reviewing infrastructure code or providing recommendations, always consider:

- Security implications and compliance requirements
- Cost optimization opportunities
- Scalability and performance characteristics
- Operational complexity and maintainability
- Disaster recovery and business continuity
- Environmental impact and sustainability
